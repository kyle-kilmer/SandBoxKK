                        George M. Dentes, a native of Ithaca, New York, originally created CrimeTime in
                        1996. George received his undergraduate and law degrees from Cornell University.
                        George served as an Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District
                        Attorney’s Office before returning to his hometown where he was elected Tompkins
                        County District Attorney in 1989. George served as DA for sixteen years, during
                        which time he won the respect and admiration of his colleagues across New York State
                        for his keen legal mind, his tenacity as an advocate, and his fundamental decency
                        in discharging his duties as a public prosecutor. In January 2006, George joined
                        the staff of NYPTI, and he brought to the organization his great talent and engaging
                        personality. George’s sudden and untimely passing in the fall of 2006 caused the
                        future of CrimeTime to be in a state of uncertainty. In 2007 George’s widow, Elsie
                        Dentes, and the estate of George Dentes gave CrimeTime to NYPTI so we could continue
                        George’s passion for a program used by attorneys across New York State.</p>

                        The 1996, 1997, and 1998 versions were DOS-based programs. The 1999-2006 versions
                        were native 32-bit application, meaning it required Windows 95 or later (Windows
                        98, Windows NT, Windows ME, Windows XP, etc.). With the evolution of competing computer
                        systems, NYPTI updated the programming behind CrimeTime and converted it to a web-based
                        application in 2008.

                        With the exception of 2007, CrimeTime has been updated annually since it was first
                        released in 1996. Because crimes and sentencing provisions may change from year
                        to year, you should be sure that you are using the version of CrimeTime that matches
                        the year when the crime was committed. The stand alone install versions of CrimeTime
                        are no longer current and will not be updated in the future. Any future updates
                        will appear on the web based version. For crimes before 1996, try the 1996 version
                        (which includes some references to pre-1996 sentencing options), but finding a copy
                        may be difficult.
